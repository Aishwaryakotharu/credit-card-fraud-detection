# credit-card-fraud-detection

There are 2 objectives:
Analyze different algorithms and find the most appropriate algorithm.
Minimize fraudulent cases.


EXISTING SYSTEM:
k-means Algorithm implementation.
Only the two features with the most variance were used to train the model(2 clusters).
Changing the dimensionality of the data also made little difference on the final values.
Less  accuracy

PROPOSED SYSTEM:
We  used Kaggle datasets.
matplotlib for plotting the data, train_test_split  for  data extraction.
Logistic Regression machine learning algorithm.
Finally Confusion matrix was plotted on true and predicted.

ALGORITHM USED
Logistic regression
